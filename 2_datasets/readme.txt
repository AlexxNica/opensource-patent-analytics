To download a file from the repository click on a file name until you see View Raw. Then download the file from the Raw button OR if accessing remotely into R or another programme then copy the raw URL. 

A raw Github URL looks something like this

https://github.com/poldham/opensource-patent-analytics/blob/master/2_datasets/pizza_medium_clean/pizza.csv?raw=true

Note the raw=true at the end.
