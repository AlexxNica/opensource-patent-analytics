Actions:

Tool: VantagePoint

1. Deduplicated results to 1 record per INPADOC First Family Member. There are 576 first family members linked to 659 publications. 
2. Imported all available field in Thomson Records
3. Cleaning synthetic biology inventor names:
4. Fuzzy logic match (List Cleanup) with INPADOC First family member as the match criteria. 
5. Test other match criteria (e.g) applications. Revealed no further grouping
6. General match (no criteria) revealed no further grouping
7. Cleaned inventors using inventors original and applicant matching windows (manual). 
8. removed accents e.g. Guttierez Gomez
9. For Applicant names applied cleaning script using Derwent Applicant Codes and Long Name
10. Manual clean of results of 9 using applicant original with address and inventor matching
11. Applied script for AcadGov etc in VantagePoint. Manually assigned missed results based on web lookup. Non-profit research organisations are allocated to academic.
12. Title (original), applied proper case to remove capitals
13. Country code fields. Applied thesaurus to generate full country names (all applicable fields, e.g publication country, inventors, etc.)
14. Family member counts. Create matrix of INPADOC First Family Members (as rows) and INPADOC Family Members as columns. Count columns (matrixrowsum) in VantagePoint
to generate counts of family members
15. Citing Patent counts by family. Create matrix of INPADOC First Family Members against citing patent number
16. Merged Abstract (Words), Abstract (Phrases), Claims (Words), Claims (Phrases), Title (Words), Title (Phrases) into one field called TAC Words Phrases
17. Applied Thesaurus to International Patent Classification
18. Applied Thesaurus to Cooperative Patent Classification
19. Applied Proper case to Cooperative Patent classification
20. Basic manual clean up of Citing First Assignee
21. Links to espacenet generated on publication numbers. 
22. Classified patent family members into Applications based on A kind codes (except US before 2001, assigned to grants).Grants assumed on kind code B. Looked up T, D codes
for relevant countries using (http://www.thomsonfilehistories.com/docs/RESOURCES_Kind%20Codes%20by%20Country.pdf) and WIPO standard (http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/standards/en/pdf/07-03-02.pdf)
Note that assumption on Kind code A and B as equivalent to applications and grants respectively is strictly a proxy measure and is likely to require adjustment for varying uses. 
23. Mapped the Global Names Index to the TAC (Title, Abstracts and Claims) field as a precise match. Note that this will not capture all instances for which a 'contains' search would be needed. Species data is therefore indicative rather than definitive. 
24. Cross mapped groups from title, abstract and claims to show phrases origins.
25. Created raw groups for composite terms for bio, nano and `-` that are not identified as multi-word phrases. Reviewed top results. 
26. Applied claims stop list to remove claims, claims 1-x etc. and created new list 
27. Basic clean up of cited literature
28. Identified and created group on DOIs for Cited literature
29. Imported family size calculation
30. Removed brackets and punctuation from field names
31. Created SEQ ID field based on search for SEQ, SEQ ID, SEQID, sequence or sequences in TAC Words and Phrases. May require further work. 
32. Compared SEQ list with claims phrases list (note phrases only) and created TAC Words Phrases SEQ Claims.
33. Applied proper case to Attorney Agent field.
34. Main text fields moved to end of sequence of fields for ease of manipulation later.
35. Exported limited set of fields to .csv
36. In excel character encoding problems emerged through lack of recognition of UTF8. Opened and edited in Open Office Calc as UTF8
37. Export markers removed, column names edited for legibility, column names to lower case. Filled spaces in names with '_'.
38. International classifications. Note classification is international classification 8 (IPC8).cpc refers to the Cooperative Patent Classification.
39. Export of full claims created spill over into blank cells. Data omitted. 
40. Imported .csv to RStudio and filled blank cells with NA. Rexported. See synbio_na_16052015.csv in Workings folder for details. 
41. Check revealed some noise created in final columns. Simply deleted. 
41. Generated split files in RStudio with tidyr and dplyr for inventors, assignees (applicants), IPCs, species etc. and saved. 
42. Trimmed white space from split steps and checked calculations in Vantage Point.
